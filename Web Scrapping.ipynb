NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you\\'re like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.<br />VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you\\'ll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don\\'t get as much light information at night, but it\\'ll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it\\'s amazing! TRUST ME.<br />SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.<br />CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you\\'re doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.<br />if camera isn\\'t as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you\\'ll be happy with what you capture.<br /><br />*just realized i said i\\'ll be concise hahahah* *i\\'ll try again*<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON\\'T MISUNDERSTAND- it\\'s good. definitely. but it didn\\'t quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i\\'m not the only one who felt that way.<br />BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.<br />if you\\'re an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won\\'t be disappointed. i don\\'t play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.<br />BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you\\'re a casual user, then you\\'ll be VERY happy with the battery backup.<br /><br />CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn\\'t throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.<br /><br />SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it\\'s quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that\\'s not what was intended originally. please don\\'t blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you\\'ll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!<br /><br />DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i\\'m in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.<br />i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don\\'t be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don\\'t have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won\\'t be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don\\'t push it though.<br /><br />FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you\\'re still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn\\'t stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn\\'t as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).<br />DON\\'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don\\'t compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.<br />THAT\\'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN\\'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn\\'t induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT\\'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like \\'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?\\' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn\\'t fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they\\'re achieving this, but i don\\'t feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i\\'m glad that they didn\\'t loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.<br />NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.<br /><br />i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn\\'t have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it\\'s worth it as long as you don\\'t have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it\\'ll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.<br /><br />signing off,<br />alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)<br />ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it\\'s all based on phones, you\\'ll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the

OnePlus 6T</span></div><div class=\"a-row\"><span class=\"a-size-base a-color-secondary review-date\">Reviewed in India \\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xae\\xf0\\x9f\\x87\\xb3 on 4 November 2018</span></div><div class=\"a-row a-spacing-top-mini\"><span class=\"a-size-base\">First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....<br /><br />I don\\'t know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.<br /><br />Read till the last for my last suggestion<br /><br />1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I\\'m sure this is the best Offer one can get and I\\'m sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.<br /><br />2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.<br /><br />3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.<br /><br />4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool<br /><br />5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months<br /><br />6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.<br /><br />7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage<br /><br />8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area<br /><br />9) The charging rate is good, I\\'m sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage<br /><br />10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I\\'ve used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don\\'t like this.<br /><br />11) I\\'ve used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.<br /><br />12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That\\'s up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.<br /><br />13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I\\'m not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...<br /><br />14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here<br /><br />15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...<br /><br />I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.<br /><br />As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage condition<br /><br />Trust Me friends, don\\'t waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera</span></div></div><div\\n      class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header

NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you\\'re like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.<br />VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you\\'ll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don\\'t get as much light information at night, but it\\'ll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it\\'s amazing! TRUST ME.<br />SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.<br />CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you\\'re doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.<br />if camera isn\\'t as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you\\'ll be happy with what you capture.<br /><br />*just realized i said i\\'ll be concise hahahah* *i\\'ll try again*<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON\\'T MISUNDERSTAND- it\\'s good. definitely. but it didn\\'t quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i\\'m not the only one who felt that way.<br />BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.<br />if you\\'re an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won\\'t be disappointed. i don\\'t play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.<br />BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you\\'re a casual user, then you\\'ll be VERY happy with the battery backup.<br /><br />CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn\\'t throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.<br /><br />SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it\\'s quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that\\'s not what was intended originally. please don\\'t blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you\\'ll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!<br /><br />DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i\\'m in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.<br />i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don\\'t be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don\\'t have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won\\'t be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don\\'t push it though.<br /><br />FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you\\'re still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn\\'t stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn\\'t as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).<br />DON\\'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don\\'t compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.<br />THAT\\'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN\\'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn\\'t induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT\\'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like \\'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?\\' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn\\'t fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they\\'re achieving this, but i don\\'t feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i\\'m glad that they didn\\'t loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.<br />NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.<br /><br />i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn\\'t have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it\\'s worth it as long as you don\\'t have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it\\'ll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.<br /><br />signing off,<br />alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)<br />ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it\\'s all based on phones, you\\'ll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).</span>\\n  \\n</span></div><div class=\"a-popover-preload\" id=\"a-popover-R2KKIWE3QR0EWE_gallerySection_main\">\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\t\\t \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"R2KKIWE3QR0EWE_image_popover\" data-hook=\"image-popover\" class=\"a-section cr-lightbox-popover-container\">\\n\\n    \\n        \\n        \\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-image-viewer\">\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-main-image-container\">\\n            <img alt=\"Customer image\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif\" class=\"cr-lightbox-main-image\"/>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-container cr-lightbox-navigator-container__back\">\\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-button cr-lightbox-navigator-button__back\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-container cr-lightbox-navigator-container__next\">\\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-button cr-lightbox-navigator-button__next\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"a-section cr-lightbox-review-information\">\\n        <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-mini cr-review-stars-and-title\">\\n\\n            \\n\\n            <i class=\"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-4 cr-lightbox-review-rating\"><span class=\"a-icon-alt\">4.0 out of 5 stars</span></i>\\n            <span class=\"a-size-base cr-lightbox-review-title a-text-bold\">\\n                IS THIS IT FINALLY?

OnePlus has taken care that removing the audio jack doesn\\'t *force* one to buy new headphones.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The *phone cover* is sufficient and one wouldn\\'t need to buy a new cover unless one likes to have personalized phone covers.<br /><br />Review<br /><br />I reluctantly exchanged my note 4 for this but after weeks use, I feel this is awesome despite few glitches<br /><br />My Experience as a power user of phones:<br /><br />I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rear.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Just a Notch: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes.

OnePlus has taken care that removing the audio jack doesn\\'t *force* one to buy new headphones.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The *phone cover* is sufficient and one wouldn\\'t need to buy a new cover unless one likes to have personalized phone covers.<br /><br />Review<br /><br />I reluctantly exchanged my note 4 for this but after weeks use, I feel this is awesome despite few glitches<br /><br />My Experience as a power user of phones:<br /><br />I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rear.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Just a Notch: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed.

Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.<br /><br />But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.<br />Unfortunately, that exposure doesn\\'t do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn\\'t much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.<br />The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost\\'s eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3\\'s shot. This is without the Pixel 3\\'s forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device\\'s low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shot is more true-to-life \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there\\'s not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3\\'s result.<br />Performance: Flagship speed for less<br /><br />The 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone\\'s 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung\\'s Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google\\'s Pixel 3 XL (4GB).<br />Battery Life<br /><br />The OnePlus 6T\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6\\'s 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile\\'s LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.<br /><br />In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.<br />OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XR<br /><br />The OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple\\'s most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the 6T\\'s 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR\\'s 6.1-inch screen.<br /><br />For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.<br />OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to Know<br /><br />The 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor\\'s lightning fast and amazing.<br />T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon\\'s network.<br />Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.<br />Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn\\'t feel bloated.<br />New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.<br />A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus\\' new Warp Charge system.<br />Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notch<br /><br />OnePlus isn\\'t pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn\\'t releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6\\'s display. The 6T\\'s bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor\\'s. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.<br />glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it\\'s true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.<br /><br />Display: Still stunning<br /><br />The OnePlus 6T\\xe2\\x80\\x99s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6\\'s screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6\\'s iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don\\'t.<br />AGAINST<br />\\'Only\\' full HD resolution<br />No microSD card slot</span>\\n  \\n</span></div><div class=\"a-popover-preload\" id=\"a-popover-R3KMI9HO4C2SUM_gallerySection_main\">\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\t\\t \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"R3KMI9HO4C2SUM_image_popover\" data-hook=\"image-popover\" class=\"a-section cr-lightbox-popover-container\">\\n\\n    \\n        \\n        \\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-image-viewer\">\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-main-image-container\">\\n            <img alt=\"Customer image\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif\" class=\"cr-lightbox-main-image\"/>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-container cr-lightbox-navigator-container__back\">\\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-button cr-lightbox-navigator-button__back\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-container cr-lightbox-navigator-container__next\">\\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-button cr-lightbox-navigator-button__next\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"a-section cr-lightbox-review-information\">\\n        <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-mini cr-review-stars-and-title\">\\n\\n            \\n\\n            <i class=\"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-4 cr-lightbox-review-rating\"><span class=\"a-icon-alt\">4.0 out of 5 stars</span></i>\\n            <span class=\"a-size-base cr-lightbox-review-title a-text-bold\">\\n                Very good\\n            </span>\\n            <br>\\n            <span class=\"a-size-small a-color-secondary cr-lightbox-review-origin\">\\n                \\n                    \\n                    \\n                        \\n                            \\n                                By Arun kumar T.A on 23 May 2019\\n                            \\n                            \\n                        \\n                    \\n                \\n            </span>\\n        </div>\\n        <span class=\"a-size-base cr-lightbox-review-body\">\\n            Verdict<br />The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.<br /><br />Pros<br />New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edge<br />Up-to-date, versatile OS<br />Fast Charge is still great<br />Sleek, premium design<br />Great performance<br />Great battery life<br />Cons<br />Camera\\'s Nightscape mode needs work<br />Another headphone jack bites the dust<br />Fingerprint sensor needs refinement<br />Poor audio capabilities<br />his affordable Android flagship sports a lightning-fast in-display fingerprint sensor and powerful performance for half the price of its rivals.<br />Super-fast in-display fingerprint sensor<br />Gorgeous display with tiny teardrop notch<br />Improved camera support<br />Android Pie out of the box.<br />AGAINST<br />No headphone jack<br />Lacks wireless charging<br />Camera: Improved, but not amazing<br /><br />OnePlus didn\\'t make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T.

Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....<br /><br />I don\\'t know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.<br /><br />Read till the last for my last suggestion<br /><br />1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I\\'m sure this is the best Offer one can get and I\\'m sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.<br /><br />2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.<br /><br />3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.<br /><br />4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool<br /><br />5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months<br /><br />6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.<br /><br />7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage<br /><br />8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area<br /><br />9) The charging rate is good, I\\'m sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage<br /><br />10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I\\'ve used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don\\'t like this.<br /><br />11) I\\'ve used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.<br /><br />12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That\\'s up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.<br /><br />13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I\\'m not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...<br /><br />14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here<br /><br />15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...<br /><br />I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.<br /><br />As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage condition<br /><br />Trust Me friends, don\\'t waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera</span>\\n  \\n</span></div><div class=\"a-row review-comments comments-for-R1ETV4AKRYRTX\"><div data-reftag=\"cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn\" data-a-expander-name=\"review_comment_expander\" class=\"a-row a-expander-container a-expander-inline-container cr-vote-action-bar\"><span class=\"cr-vote\" data-hook=\"review-voting-widget\">\\n  <div class=\"a-row a-spacing-small\"><span data-hook=\"helpful-vote-statement\" class=\"a-size-base a-color-tertiary cr-vote-text\">12 people found this helpful</span></div><div class=\"cr-helpful-button aok-float-left\">\\n      <span class=\"a-button a-button-base\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.in%2FOnePlus-Mirror-Black-128GB-Storage%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB07DJHV6VZ%3FreviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhDEvtXAR20rJdQkVExCHkXd1NSwR6cPcCZAjnoGaQi7OAAAAAGMzWAEAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR1ETV4AKRYRTX&amp;openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&amp;openid.assoc_handle=inflex&amp;openid.mode=checkid_setup&amp;marketPlaceId=A21TJRUUN4KGV&amp;language=en&amp;openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&amp;openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0\" data-hook=\"vote-helpful-button\" class=\"a-button-text\"><div class=\"cr-helpful-text\">\\n          Helpful</div>\\n      </a></span></span></div>\\n  </span><span class=\"cr-footer-line-height\">\\n          <span><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-text-separator\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"|\"></i><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"cr-popup\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-cr-popup\" data-cr-popup=\"{&quot;width&quot;:&quot;580&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;ReportAbuse&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&amp;csrfT=hDEvtXAR20rJdQkVExCHkXd1NSwR6cPcCZAjnoGaQi7OAAAAAGMzWAEAAAAB&amp;reviewId=R1ETV4AKRYRTX&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;380&quot;}\"><a class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal a-color-secondary report-abuse-link a-text-normal\" href=\"/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&amp;csrfT=hDEvtXAR20rJdQkVExCHkXd1NSwR6cPcCZAjnoGaQi7OAAAAAGMzWAEAAAAB&amp;reviewId=R1ETV4AKRYRTX\">Report abuse</a></span></span></span>\\n\\n        <div aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content a-spacing-top-base a-spacing-large a-expander-inline-content a-expander-inner\" style=\"display:none\"><div class=\"a-row a-spacing-mini review-comments-header aok-hidden\"><ul class=\"a-viewoptions-list a-viewoptions-section a-span12\">\\n    <div class=\"a-row a-spacing-none a-grid-vertical-align a-grid-center\"><div class=\"a-column a-span6\"><span class=\"a-size-base a-viewoptions-list-label\">Showing <span class=\\'review-comment-count\\'>0</span> comments</span></div></div></ul>\\n</div><div class=\"a-section a-spacing-extra-large a-spacing-top-medium a-text-center comment-load-error aok-hidden\"><div class=\"a-box a-alert a-alert-error cr-error\" role=\"alert\"><div class=\"a-box-inner a-alert-container\"><h4 class=\"a-alert-heading\">There was a problem loading comments right now.

Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.<br /><br />PROS:<br />----------------<br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.<br />Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I\\'ve got: 9.5 hours.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you\\'re gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it\\'s extremely impressive. Detailed & crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn\\'t work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You\\'ll need to place your finger correctly else, you\\'ll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it\\'s the best out there.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 SMOOTH & SLICK OS: I love the UI & UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 STUNNING DESIGN & BUILD: The build quality & design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don\\'t worry, it looks beautiful and you\\'ll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).<br /><br />CONS:<br />----------------<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can\\'t always carry the dongle around, can you? You\\'ll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you\\'ll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won\\'t miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation:<br /> 1) If the phone senses that it\\'s being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through.<br /> 2) If you\\'re holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.<br />The output is not always crisp. It\\'s a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don\\'t zoom closely into the subject, it\\'ll look good.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can\\'t really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It\\'s almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It\\'s loud enough, just not clear enough.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you\\'re holding it in your hand. You\\'ll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that\\'s only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.<br /><br />Thumbs up if you found this helpful!</span>\\n  \\n</span></div><div class=\"a-popover-preload\" id=\"a-popover-RMVBXPM5WFH0L_gallerySection_main\">\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\t\\t \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"RMVBXPM5WFH0L_image_popover\" data-hook=\"image-popover\" class=\"a-section cr-lightbox-popover-container\">\\n\\n    \\n        \\n        \\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-image-viewer\">\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-main-image-container\">\\n            <img alt=\"Customer image\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif\" class=\"cr-lightbox-main-image\"/>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-container cr-lightbox-navigator-container__back\">\\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-button cr-lightbox-navigator-button__back\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-container cr-lightbox-navigator-container__next\">\\n            <div class=\"cr-lightbox-navigator-button cr-lightbox-navigator-button__next\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"a-section cr-lightbox-review-information\">\\n        <div class=\"a-section a-spacing-mini cr-review-stars-and-title\">\\n\\n            \\n\\n            <i class=\"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 cr-lightbox-review-rating\"><span class=\"a-icon-alt\">5.0 out of 5 stars</span></i>\\n            <span class=\"a-size-base cr-lightbox-review-title a-text-bold\">\\n                The Underdog Champion\\n            </span>\\n            <br>\\n            <span class=\"a-size-small a-color-secondary cr-lightbox-review-origin\">\\n                \\n                    \\n                    \\n                        \\n                            \\n                                By Kevin Miranda on 18 April 2019\\n                            \\n                            \\n                        \\n                    \\n                \\n            </span>\\n        </div>\\n        <span class=\"a-size-base cr-lightbox-review-body\">\\n            Review after 5 months of usage.

Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don\\'t worry, it looks beautiful and you\\'ll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).<br /><br />CONS:<br />----------------<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can\\'t always carry the dongle around, can you? You\\'ll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you\\'ll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won\\'t miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation:<br /> 1) If the phone senses that it\\'s being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through.<br /> 2) If you\\'re holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.<br />The output is not always crisp. It\\'s a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don\\'t zoom closely into the subject, it\\'ll look good.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can\\'t really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It\\'s almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It\\'s loud enough, just not clear enough.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you\\'re holding it in your hand. You\\'ll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.<br /><br />\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that\\'s only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.<br /><br />Thumbs up if you found this helpful!\\n        </span>\\n        <div class=\"a-section

Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.<br /><br />Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.<br /><br />Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.<br /><br />Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.<br /><br />Battery life ?/10: It\\'s still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I\\'ve consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.<br /><br />New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It\\'s plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you\\'re someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.<br /><br />Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it\\'s only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn\\'t affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here.

Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.<br /><br />Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.<br /><br />Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.<br /><br />Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.<br /><br />Battery life ?/10: It\\'s still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I\\'ve consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.<br /><br />New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It\\'s plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you\\'re someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.<br /><br />Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it\\'s only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn\\'t affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />+Screen<br />+Battery<br />+Internals<br />+Software<br />+Camera<br />+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer<br /><br />-no 3.5mm jack<br />-no wireless charging (not important for me)<br /><br />BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT.

OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you\\'d be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don\\'t think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you\\'d be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I\\'d use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn\\'t take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn\\'t recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.<br /><br />All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.</span>\\n  \\n</span></div><div class=\"a-row review-comments comments-for-R16GF7IYYZGK89\"><div data-reftag=\"cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn\" data-a-expander-name=\"review_comment_expander\" class=\"a-row a-expander-container a-expander-inline-container cr-vote-action-bar\"><span class=\"cr-vote\" data-hook=\"review-voting-widget\">\\n  <div class=\"a-row a-spacing-small\"><span data-hook=\"helpful-vote-statement\" class=\"a-size-base a-color-tertiary cr-vote-text\">One person found this helpful</span></div><div class=\"cr-helpful-button aok-float-left\">\\n      <span class=\"a-button a-button-base\"><span class=\"a-button-inner\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/ap/signin?openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.in%2FOnePlus-Mirror-Black-128GB-Storage%2Fproduct-reviews%2FB07DJHV6VZ%3FreviewerType%3Dall_reviews%26csrfT%3DhGQR0iI0kXysvOTdOgCzLeJZb7%252FeOQxPIRc4TLEHJVyoAAAAAGMzWAEAAAAB%26reviewId%3DR16GF7IYYZGK89&amp;openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&amp;openid.assoc_handle=inflex&amp;openid.mode=checkid_setup&amp;marketPlaceId=A21TJRUUN4KGV&amp;language=en&amp;openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&amp;openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0\" data-hook=\"vote-helpful-button\" class=\"a-button-text\"><div class=\"cr-helpful-text\">\\n          Helpful</div>\\n      </a></span></span></div>\\n  </span><span class=\"cr-footer-line-height\">\\n          <span><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-text-separator\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"|\"></i><span class=\"a-declarative\" data-action=\"cr-popup\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-cr-popup\" data-cr-popup=\"{&quot;width&quot;:&quot;580&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;ReportAbuse&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&amp;csrfT=hGQR0iI0kXysvOTdOgCzLeJZb7%2FeOQxPIRc4TLEHJVyoAAAAAGMzWAEAAAAB&amp;reviewId=R16GF7IYYZGK89&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;380&quot;}\"><a class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal a-color-secondary report-abuse-link a-text-normal\" href=\"/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_hlp&amp;csrfT=hGQR0iI0kXysvOTdOgCzLeJZb7%2FeOQxPIRc4TLEHJVyoAAAAAGMzWAEAAAAB&amp;reviewId=R16GF7IYYZGK89\">Report abuse</a></span></span></span>\\n\\n        <div aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content a-spacing-top-base a-spacing-large a-expander-inline-content a-expander-inner\" style=\"display:none\"><div class=\"a-row a-spacing-mini review-comments-header aok-hidden\"><ul class=\"a-viewoptions-list a-viewoptions-section a-span12\">\\n    <div class=\"a-row a-spacing-none a-grid-vertical-align a-grid-center\"><div class=\"a-column a-span6\"><span class=\"a-size-base a-viewoptions-list-label\">Showing <span class=\\'review-comment-count\\'>0</span> comments</span></div></div></ul>\\n</div><div class=\"a-section a-spacing-extra-large a-spacing-top-medium a-text-center comment-load-error aok-hidden\"><div class=\"a-box a-alert a-alert-error cr-error\" role=\"alert\"><div class=\"a-box-inner a-alert-container\"><h4 class=\"a-alert-heading\">There was a problem loading comments right now.

NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.\n",

GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results.

YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out.

BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better &amp; c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.\n",

Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage.

To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That's up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.\n",

NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.\n",

      "                    NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur &amp; a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:\n",

      "                  • The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.\n",

      "                  • Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.\n",

      "                  • In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.\n",

Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.\n",

It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.\n",

But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.\n",

Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly.

      "                    I bought this phone by using the exchange offer with the MI Note 4 that I had used for over two years. Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur &amp; a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:\n",

      "                    • The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.\n",

      "                    • Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.\n",

      "                    • In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.\n",

Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.\n",

It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.\n",

But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.\n",

Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.\n",

The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's.

OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone.

Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's.

OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone.

You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.\n",

It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.\n",

The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.\n",

You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.\n",

In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.\n",

While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.\n",

      "                    Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.\n",

      "                  Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.\n",

       " <span> apologies for the seemingly 'clickbait' title of this review. i'll be as concise as i can.<br/>tl;dr: great battery life, a well tuned camera. go for it (this isn't a paid/fake review lol)!<br/><br/>CAMERA: has a really high dynamic range. i have been doing street photography since two years now, all based out of a phone camera, as opposed to a dslr or something. although previously i have used budget devices (occasionally a flagship phone belonging to someone else), i have learned a lot. since my genre involves capturing a quick moment, a good/smart hdr process really comes handy. this phone retains details in the HIGHLIGHTS much, much better than a galaxy s9/note 9, iphone x, comparable to pixel 2xl. nope, no exxageration. zoom performance is okay, as it's digital. the secondary lens seems gimmicky, with the company claiming it to help with depth sensing. on covering the second lens, a message does pop up (in the portrait mode). i feel like they can utilize it better with different algorithms. i see wasted potential. the hardware is the same as op6. NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.<br/>VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.<br/>SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.<br/>CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.<br/>if camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.<br/><br/>*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.<br/>BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.<br/>if you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.<br/>BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.<br/><br/>CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.<br/><br/>SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!<br/><br/>DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.<br/>i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.<br/><br/>FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).<br/>DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.<br/>THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better &amp; c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.<br/>NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.<br/><br/>i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.<br/><br/>signing off,<br/>alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)<br/>ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).</span>\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur &amp; a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:<br/><br/>• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.<br/><br/>• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.<br/><br/>• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.<br/><br/>• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.<br/><br/>• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.<br/><br/>• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.<br/><br/>• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.<br/><br/>• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.<br/><br/>• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.<br/><br/>• Larger &amp; stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!<br/><br/>• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.<br/><br/>• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.<br/><br/>• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.<br/><br/>• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.<br/><br/>•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.<br/><br/>• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).<br/><br/>• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.</span>\n",

       " <span>Verdict<br/>The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edge<br/>Up-to-date, versatile OS<br/>Fast Charge is still great<br/>Sleek, premium design<br/>Great performance<br/>Great battery life<br/>Cons<br/>Camera's Nightscape mode needs work<br/>Another headphone jack bites the dust<br/>Fingerprint sensor needs refinement<br/>Poor audio capabilities<br/>his affordable Android flagship sports a lightning-fast in-display fingerprint sensor and powerful performance for half the price of its rivals.<br/>Super-fast in-display fingerprint sensor<br/>Gorgeous display with tiny teardrop notch<br/>Improved camera support<br/>Android Pie out of the box.<br/>AGAINST<br/>No headphone jack<br/>Lacks wireless charging<br/>Camera: Improved, but not amazing<br/><br/>OnePlus didn't make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T. Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.<br/><br/>But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.<br/>Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.<br/>The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.<br/>Performance: Flagship speed for less<br/><br/>The 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).<br/>Battery Life<br/><br/>The OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.<br/><br/>In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.<br/>OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XR<br/><br/>The OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.<br/><br/>For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.<br/>OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to Know<br/><br/>The 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.<br/>T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.<br/>Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.<br/>Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.<br/>New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.<br/>A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.<br/>Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notch<br/><br/>OnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.<br/>glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.<br/><br/>Display: Still stunning<br/><br/>The OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.<br/>AGAINST<br/>'Only' full HD resolution<br/>No microSD card slot</span>\n",

       " <span>First &amp; Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc &amp; 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....<br/><br/>I don't know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.<br/><br/>Read till the last for my last suggestion<br/><br/>1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I'm sure this is the best Offer one can get and I'm sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.<br/><br/>2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.<br/><br/>3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.<br/><br/>4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool<br/><br/>5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months<br/><br/>6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts &amp; Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive &amp; I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.<br/><br/>7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes &amp; 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel &amp; Jio, don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage<br/><br/>8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area<br/><br/>9) The charging rate is good, I'm sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don't worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage<br/><br/>10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I've used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don't like this.<br/><br/>11) I've used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.<br/><br/>12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That's up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.<br/><br/>13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I'm not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...<br/><br/>14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here<br/><br/>15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...<br/><br/>I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.<br/><br/>As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage condition<br/><br/>Trust Me friends, don't waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera</span>\n",

       " <span>Review after 5 months of usage. Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>----------------<br/>• GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.<br/>Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I've got: 9.5 hours.<br/><br/>• IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you're gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)<br/><br/>• GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it's extremely impressive. Detailed &amp; crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.<br/><br/>• CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn't work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You'll need to place your finger correctly else, you'll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it's the best out there.<br/><br/>• RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)<br/><br/>• SMOOTH &amp; SLICK OS: I love the UI &amp; UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.<br/><br/>• STUNNING DESIGN &amp; BUILD: The build quality &amp; design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don't worry, it looks beautiful and you'll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>----------------<br/><br/>• RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can't always carry the dongle around, can you? You'll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you'll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won't miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.<br/><br/>• BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation:<br/> 1) If the phone senses that it's being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through.<br/> 2) If you're holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.<br/>The output is not always crisp. It's a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don't zoom closely into the subject, it'll look good.<br/><br/>• IN-BUILD SPEAKER &amp; EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can't really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It's almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It's loud enough, just not clear enough.<br/><br/>• EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 &amp; 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you're holding it in your hand. You'll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.<br/><br/>• BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that's only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.<br/><br/>Thumbs up if you found this helpful!</span>\n",

       " <span>I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.<br/><br/>Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.<br/><br/>Now onto the phone...<br/><br/>Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.<br/><br/>Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.<br/><br/>Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.<br/><br/>Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.<br/><br/>Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.<br/><br/>New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.<br/><br/>Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>+Screen<br/>+Battery<br/>+Internals<br/>+Software<br/>+Camera<br/>+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer<br/><br/>-no 3.5mm jack<br/>-no wireless charging (not important for me)<br/><br/>BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!</span>\n",

       " <span>Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.<br/><br/>All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.</span>\n",

NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.if camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.if you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.signing off,alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).\\n\",\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.• Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.\\n\",\n",

Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nFirst & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....I don\\'t know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.Read till the last for my last suggestion1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I\\'m sure this is the best Offer one can get and I\\'m sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area9) The charging rate is good, I\\'m sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I\\'ve used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don\\'t like this.11) I\\'ve used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That\\'s up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I\\'m not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage conditionTrust Me friends, don\\'t waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nReview after 5 months of usage. Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.PROS:----------------• GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I've got: 9.5 hours.• IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you're gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)• GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it's extremely impressive. Detailed & crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.• CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn't work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You'll need to place your finger correctly else, you'll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it's the best out there.• RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)• SMOOTH & SLICK OS: I love the UI & UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.• STUNNING DESIGN & BUILD: The build quality & design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don't worry, it looks beautiful and you'll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).CONS:----------------• RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can't always carry the dongle around, can you? You'll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you'll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won't miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.• BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation: 1) If the phone senses that it's being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through. 2) If you're holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.The output is not always crisp. It's a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don't zoom closely into the subject, it'll look good.• IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can't really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It's almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It's loud enough, just not clear enough.• EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you're holding it in your hand. You'll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.• BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that's only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.Thumbs up if you found this helpful!\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nI'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nIl try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.\\n\"]"

NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.if camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.if you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.signing off,alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).\\n\",\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.• Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.\\n\",\n",

Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot\\n\",\n",

       " 'First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....I don\\'t know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.Read till the last for my last suggestion1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I\\'m sure this is the best Offer one can get and I\\'m sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area9) The charging rate is good, I\\'m sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I\\'ve used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don\\'t like this.11) I\\'ve used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That\\'s up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I\\'m not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage conditionTrust Me friends, don\\'t waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera\\n',\n",

       " \"Review after 5 months of usage. Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.PROS:----------------• GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I've got: 9.5 hours.• IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you're gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)• GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it's extremely impressive. Detailed & crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.• CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn't work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You'll need to place your finger correctly else, you'll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it's the best out there.• RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)• SMOOTH & SLICK OS: I love the UI & UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.• STUNNING DESIGN & BUILD: The build quality & design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don't worry, it looks beautiful and you'll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).CONS:----------------• RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can't always carry the dongle around, can you? You'll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you'll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won't miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.• BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation: 1) If the phone senses that it's being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through. 2) If you're holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.The output is not always crisp. It's a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don't zoom closely into the subject, it'll look good.• IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can't really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It's almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It's loud enough, just not clear enough.• EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you're holding it in your hand. You'll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.• BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that's only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.Thumbs up if you found this helpful!\\n\",\n",

       " \"I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.\\n\"]"

NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.if camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.if you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.signing off,alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).\",\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.• Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.\",\n",

Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot\",\n",
       " 'Speaker has got problem. I replace it one year back. Again I had same issue for my speaker Using 50k+ phone and I have use bluetooth. So sad...',\n",
       " 'First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....I don\\'t know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.Read till the last for my last suggestion1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I\\'m sure this is the best Offer one can get and I\\'m sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area9) The charging rate is good, I\\'m sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I\\'ve used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don\\'t like this.11) I\\'ve used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That\\'s up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I\\'m not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage conditionTrust Me friends, don\\'t waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera',\n",

       " \"Review after 5 months of usage. Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.PROS:----------------• GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I've got: 9.5 hours.• IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you're gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)• GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it's extremely impressive. Detailed & crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.• CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn't work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You'll need to place your finger correctly else, you'll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it's the best out there.• RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)• SMOOTH & SLICK OS: I love the UI & UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.• STUNNING DESIGN & BUILD: The build quality & design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don't worry, it looks beautiful and you'll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).CONS:----------------• RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can't always carry the dongle around, can you? You'll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you'll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won't miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.• BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation: 1) If the phone senses that it's being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through. 2) If you're holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.The output is not always crisp. It's a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don't zoom closely into the subject, it'll look good.• IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can't really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It's almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It's loud enough, just not clear enough.• EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you're holding it in your hand. You'll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.• BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that's only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.Thumbs up if you found this helpful!\",\n",
       " 'Best phone of my life till now',\n",
       " \"I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!\",\n",
       " \"Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.\"]"

NIGHT SIGHT from the ported gcam app is INSANE. the stock app is also great at processing photos in LOWLIGHT. if you're like me, if you feel like capturing something in the middle of the night because it looks magical, this camera will not let you down.VIDEO: if you have tried any sort of filmmaking, you'll understand the importance of shooting in 60fps over 30. NOTE- ois is used for 1080/4k 60fps. eis is used for 1080/4k 30fps. eis is amazing during the day, but falls short at night. 4k 60 means you don't get as much light information at night, but it'll have better stabilization. i wish there was some way to manually change that. the final output, once you realize these certain points and use it to your advantage, then it's amazing! TRUST ME.SELFIE: video called to 1080p with eis, has a great dynamic range. but, i feel like the gcam mode performs better while taking selfies, especially selfie portraits.CAMERA final thoughts: if you know what you're doing, GO BUY THIS PHONE.if camera isn't as important to you, then please read on. 4 times out of 5 you'll be happy with what you capture.*just realized i said i'll be concise hahahah* *i'll try again*BATTERY LIFE: the first few days of extreme heavy usage set me back a bit disappointed, as i got a bit more than 6 hours of sot. DON'T MISUNDERSTAND- it's good. definitely. but it didn't quite match up to what i saw online. so get this, i'm not the only one who felt that way.BUT WAIT! after using this phone for 3 weeks (give or take) battery life has improved. i have provided a screenshot for the initial usage, which shows a little over 6 hours. YESTERDAY, i got nearly TEN HOURS.if you're an average user, but still feel like you use the phone heavily because of a few gaming sessions, you won't be disappointed. i don't play games much, but my camera usage is extreme. that explained why i felt disappointed.BATTERY FINAL THOUGHTS? most of you out there can use this phone easily for an entire day. if you're a casual user, then you'll be VERY happy with the battery backup.CHARGING: dash/rapid/warp charge- as fast as ever. 10/10. doesn't throttle the performance. neither does the charging slow down with simultaneous use.SCREEN: I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT CALIBRATED MODES! oneplus does it right. it's quite accurate. i use dci-p3. for most default is best, as the colors have a lot of saturation, with inky blacks. GOOD brightness, not great though with direct sunlight. BUT WAIT! a paid app (search high brightness mode) enables the actual potential. NOT KIDDING. basically, oneplus has restricted the maximum brightness you can get, to ensure longevity (FOR A GOOD REASON). use that app at your own risk, as toggling it on for long periods of time may be harmful for the phone, as that's not what was intended originally. please don't blame me if you use it without researching further. however, if you are smart about it, you'll be REALLY HAPPY with the results. HONESTLY!DESIGN/BUILD QUALITY: this is something HIGHLY subjective. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. personally, i'm in love with the minimalism and symmetry. despite the beautiful glossy finish of mirror black, i feel like midnight black/thunder purple showcases how much oneplus cares about ERGONOMICS. i am usually horribly careless with my phones. and this has a glass back, way less durable, seemingly. YET, i feel safe while holding this. they have oaid attention to subtle things, like the amount of curve at the edges of the backside, to make it easier to grip. the matte texture feels so close to a metallic surface, im not lying. if anyone you know has a 6 or a 6t with a matte surface, please do check it out. NOTE: please make sure you have a case on, as glass is glass.i have dropped this phone 4-5 times (which made my heart skip a beat every time). one of the corners has a slight dent (which still makes me feel really sad). however, the materials used are really good. op6 had gorilla glass 5, this has gorilla glass 6. don't be fooled though, glass always has a high chance of breaking. oneplus phones last a long while. they don't have any water/dust resistance certification, but the phone won't be damaged if it comes in contact with water. please don't push it though.FINGERPRINT SCANNER: *evil laugh* if you're still reading, i cannot thank you enough. i hope i was able to help you understand the experience a bit better. okay, i shouldn't stall amy more. the fingerprint scanner isn't as fast, or as secure, or as adept as a regular capacitive scanner (read: oneplus phones before 6t).DON'T MISUNDERSTAND THOUGH. if you don't compare, oneplus makes the experience seem really smooth. yes, the accuracy suffers a bit. BUT, the novelty of this feature, i feel, makes up for it. it makes me smile every time i use it.THAT'S NOT THE ENTIRE STORY THOUGH! oneplus claims it becomes faster with time. at first, in my first week, i felt like this was a smart way of creating a placebo effect. the words felt like a plain marketing talk. BUT, THEY WEREN'T WRONG. i understand the arguments against the scanner, mainly, a) it forces you to look at the screen everytime you want to unlock, in which case the face unlock despite being less secure, would be faster, b) the positioning could be better & c) the feedback doesn't induce confidence if you actually unlocked or not. true, true and true. BUT, as skeptic as i was, i promise you, it has gotten better and faster. how do i attest that? well, earlier success rate was 75%. it did feel like a let down. it seemed half baked. change for the sake of change. NOW, IT'S UP TO 95%. initially it made me feel angry at oneplus, as it felt like 'IS THIS IT FINALLY? has oneplus SETTLED?' *there you go, the headline of my review* jokes aside, the angles that would fail before, wouldn't fail anymore. i do have a guess at how they're achieving this, but i don't feel like boring you any more than i already have. i tried my best to be as honest and unbiased as i could have. let that strengthen your confidence in my verdict about the scanner. trust me. it gets better with time. this is due to artificial intelligence and i'm glad that they didn't loosely throw around the term (*cough* LG/HUAWEI/OPPO *cough*). the way artificial intelligence works, i can ASSURE you that it should get better with time. it has, for me.NOTE: screen protectors do change the experience. oneplus recommends you to re-register the prints. this is definitely a huge annoyance, as it could lead to wastage of money just to figure out what works. i suggest go with reviews, ones which have a more number of reviews, especially 3-4 stars and not 5. if you see a 5 star rating, it probably was the brand itself.i apologize for this long read. if you still are reading, then i think i can assume that you long for this phone. else you wouldn't have read this far. i understand. just, go for it. it's worth it as long as you don't have an op6. wait for 7 if you really want an improved experience. actually, the way they work, and if it means that much to you, wait for op7t. it'll be worth the wait. moreover the op6 will last you well over two years.signing off,alimpan pal (op6t 8+256gb)ps: i dropped out of college to pursue filmmaking. would mean a lot if you visited my instagram page. currently working on my own domain. till then please check out my work, it's all based on phones, you'll definitely find it unique. look up _theunbreakablevow_ (with the underscores).\",\n",

Being a power user, high-graphics gamer, freelance graphic designer, developer, an entrepreneur & a multi tasker, I find OnePlus 6T (OxygenOS) so much worth the purchase. Specially so when I am transitioning from MI Note 4 (MIUI). OnePlus 6T is an incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 6T with subtle but significant upgrades. But there is always something positive and negative about a device so following is what I feel about it:• The fingerprint scanner that was the key selling point for OnePlus 6T isnt as impressive as it seemed to be earlier before using the phone for a week. It is good but it isnt as fast as face recognition or back side fingerprint scanner. The major cause of this is that the back side fingerprint scanner in the previous model 6 was a definite point that was locatable but in 6T this area is on the screen and you need to tap the screen to get the area of fingerprint scanner to show and then you have to do the needful. This is like a step extra versus the previous models quick screen unlock with same level of security. This is a 2 second wasted only to unlock the screen.• The sound quality and camera quality is exceptionally awesome. No flaws in them for this level of pricing. There are few so called better ones in other brands but then better is a debatable word with camera output quality.• Storage / model options: I have seen the mirror version of version 6 with my friend and the midnight black that I have been using of version 6. Midnight black is just so so buttery smooth to enjoy and feel while using the phone that makes it seem like everything is on screen surface and covering the full screen area. Mirror version becomes boring and frustrating after a point because of the fingerprints that are left visible all over the back side of the body so easily everytime.• In-display fingerprint scanner / sensor: OnePlus’s dedicated fingerprint scanner has always been a secure and fastest scanner around. With in-display scanner they have integrated the fingerprint scanner inside the device remarkably well. It is fast enough to call it quick but sure isn’t as fast as dedicated scanner module which it implemented in OnePlus 6’s rear.• Blazing fast: There is nothing more pleasing that having a fluid experience using a phone and OnePlus 6T is blazing fast. Multi-tasking is such a breeze with 6T. Test it with almost any (and virtually as many) apps and 1+ 6T will deliver! Gaming Mode just adds to this beefy specs while you are gaming.• Gestures: After using it once and I dont want to go back to using buttons (almost definitely). The gestures add so much to its intuitive, smooth user experience, while getting work done faster and without any hassle.• Camera: I make some videos of indoor interviews often night light as well and some casual street photography. This 6T camera delivers to the price. Infact more, it is such an ease taking low-light photos without having to worry about setting up a light or finding a good light source.• Audio: The audio in this phone is aptly loud and with nice bass that a mobile phone can pack. OnePlus 6 had a very shrieky noisy sort of high-volume issue. But this one has a much more crisp and clearer stereo like speaker feel.• Faster charging: As always OnePlus is much loved for its fast charging and adding ~400 mAh to the battery 6T makes it all much more pleasing.• Larger & stronger display: The display is now Corning Gorilla Glass 6 sized at 6.41” which is just as much wide as OnePlus 6’s Corning GG 5 sized at 6.28” but with more height-giving aspect ratio of 19.5:9 aspect ratio and believe me watching movies, YouTube is such a bliss!!!• Just a Notch: It’s a huge improvement over OnePlus 6’s slab shaped huge notch. The notch in 6T is tear drop shaped and well designed, sized. It rather makes the appearance of the screen very attractive  It improves the overall usability and feel of display by many folds.• 3.5mm Audio jack is Gone: USB Type-C is all you need to charge the phone or listen to music. You need a type-C to 3.5mm audio jack/adapter within the package though which comes as a huge relief incase I am stuck with using an ordinary 3.5mm Headphones.• If you are a One Plus 6 owner you would like this thing about the charger that it is of same specifications in terms of electric input and output. You can use the same charger for both the phones. This saves you from the hassle of storing two chargers for two same brand phones.• 3700 mAh: Beefed up the battery (maybe that’s why the audio jack had to go). But this also means longer charging time with the same charger as OnePlus 6 but that is okay i think since it still is fast compared to other phones. Lot of people are crying for wireless charging. I guess they dont know about the slow charging speed and longer charging time for the smartphones. Everyone who has used the fast charger knows that wireless charging is not as great as it sounds.•  The software feature of Screen Brightness is a big dislike. Since the new OS update, OP6 and OP6T both have had very bad transition scale in terms of screen brightness. Earlier the screen was enough bright at 30% thus saving batter, but now even indoor use requires screen brightness to be set at 60% to be able to use phone properly. This is a big let down as it consumes a lot of battery.• The new software update has some improvements in Camera and gestures and some patch fixes. This is good, especially the nightscape camera features takes amazing low light contrast pictures (one nightscape mode shot pictures has been attached).• But the new swipe gesture addition to switch between previous and next apps has caused the previously existent two gestures for going to the tray and going back has become way slower and sometimes non responsive. In an effort to add something just not required, the previous smooth gestures transitions has been sacrificed. This is just wasnt called for.\",\n",

Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot\",\n",
       " 'Speaker has got problem. I replace it one year back. Again I had same issue for my speaker Using 50k+ phone and I have use bluetooth. So sad...',\n",
       " 'First & Foremost, I would say the Phone is a Beast ! Of course since the Processor is 845 Soc & 6 GB with 128 GB is a good specs in terms of the pricing ....I don\\'t know how the Hype for the OnePlus is going on and people fall prey to it. Its purely a marketing strategy but for the Specs cost is justified.Read till the last for my last suggestion1) I ordered the phone on Nov 1 as per the Offer Plan, I\\'m sure this is the best Offer one can get and I\\'m sure the next Offer will be when OnePlus 7 will be about to launch.2) The Phone is quite difficult to handle for someone who has been using a 4-5 Inch range phones for over the years. I would not recommend the OnePlus Switch as the phone gets heated even for a 15 minutes of transfer and 5GB of Data and its better you do the transfer one by one after getting the phone up and running.3) The UI Update and Night Mode update happened as soon as I got the Wi-Fi in place and they happened within 5 minutes.4) The Camera is real cool and I did take some night shots and day shots and got it reviewed with my friend who is Pro Photographer and his comment was its really cool5) The Phone charge is yet to be certified by me and the main reason I purchased this phone due to my charge retain issue, this is my 5 Phone in the last 10 years and every phone that i use comes for a days charge in the beginning, But this came for 1 day and 15 hours. Although I did a bit of gaming for the first time. Trust me any phone in the market will have a battery issue after 1 or 2 years of usage. I need to review this - But for sure will Update this Point in next 3 Months6) The App that I use for news review such as Inshorts & Dailyhunt seem to be not responsive & I did gave a feedback to them to design for such 6.41 Inch phones as these seem to be like a cricket pitch screen. So you can guess how it will be for other apps. This is my personal review.7) The power draining rate is 1% per every 8 minutes when in use and 16-20 minutes when not in use. This is just a random check that I did in the past 2 days with Wi-Fi and 4 minutes & 15-18 minutes when in Network coverage like Airtel & Jio, don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage8) The Phone gets heated up when surfing with Airtel Internet for more than 30 minutes continuously with good signal in open area9) The charging rate is good, I\\'m sure the charging rate will always remain to be good, its the discharge rate that will drastically vary as the phone gets old. don\\'t worry this number will reduce in just few months of usage10) Even though the phone is a gorilla glass there is a screen protector added to this phone, which in my opinion was not needed, I\\'ve used S2 from samsung, G4, X Play from Moto, all without screen protector. In this case I don\\'t like this.11) I\\'ve used the phone with google maps \"ON\" when driving in my car, the phone discharge rate was around 4-6 minutes appx , although the issue that I faced was there is no car charger from OnePlus on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. So I had to toggle the maps to Aero-plane mode after downloading the maps for my route.12) Go for this phone only if you are okay with spending such a huge money. To me after purchasing this phone I felt we can change the phone every year for a price rage of 10k rather than changing this phone after 2 years. That\\'s up to the individual and their desire to change from time to time. I felt disappointed after using this phone in other areas.13) The In Screen Finger Scanner is a night mare. Did you hear 0.4 Sec, Just Sh*t, it took me more than 5 attempts to get the screen un lock. I\\'m not saying any false Information here ... Trust ME ! Tried in all angle by enabling for all fingers in all possible configuration. VERY BAD ...14) The face Un lock is excellent. No comments here15) Head Phone Jack, Yes when we accepted the USB compared to a printer port, Fax Port, Screen Port, Keyboard, Mouse, the head phone from 3.5mm to Micro should be well received in the industry. They have given a converter too for those using the jack during CAR TRAVEL ...I will update other factors after further review. TRUST ME, I will put this phone in SECOND TO NONE may be soon.As of Now I would say 5 star under standard test conditions but 3 star under usage conditionTrust Me friends, don\\'t waste your money with this phone as the positives will surely switch to negatives in just a matter of few months as any battery in industry is not going to give up 100% performance. Even if you put double 845 Soc with double 6/8 GB RAM or double 128GB space or even double camera',\n",

       " \"Review after 5 months of usage. Pre-ordered and purchased it as soon as it was released in India, way back in November 2018.PROS:----------------• GREAT BATTERY LIFE: 2~2.5 days on moderate - light usage; 1~1.5 days on intense - heavy usage.Average screen on time: 5~6 hours. Max I've got: 9.5 hours.• IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE: Whether you're gaming, watching Netflix, chatting or have 30+ Chrome tabs open, prepare to have a smooth and seamless experience. No lags or stutters whatsoever (Just restart your phone once or twice a month; clear system cache if required.)• GOOD CAMERA: Agreed, the camera quality is not on par with the likes of the top-of-the-line Samsungs or Apples; but for this price range, it's extremely impressive. Detailed & crisp pictures in daylight, impressive low light photography, albeit with a few trade-offs here and there.• CUTTING EDGE IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR: The concealed fingerprint scanner is definitely faster than the others out there, usually unlocks within a couple of milliseconds on the first try, but also doesn't work as it should rarely. This is more on the software optimization side. You'll need to place your finger correctly else, you'll be stuck with your thumb on the screen for a couple of seconds. But hey, when it works, it's the best out there.• RAPID CHARGE: The fastest charging device out there currently IMO. Goes to 100% in almost an hour. (Charging happens rapidly when the battery level is below 50%, and the speed slowly reduces as the battery percentage increases. This is to reduce damage to the device and the user.)• SMOOTH & SLICK OS: I love the UI & UX of Oxygen OS. Feels almost like stock Android, but with a few perks added here and there. Feels extremely zippy executing any task.• STUNNING DESIGN & BUILD: The build quality & design of this phone is extremely impressive. Looks slick, like a beautifully crafted piece of shiny black metal. The phone feels solid and heavy too (the weight might be a con according to your preferences). Oh and the notch! Don't worry, it looks beautiful and you'll never really notice it being there once you start using the device (You can hide it if you want through the OS).CONS:----------------• RIP HEADPHONE JACK: I know, the phone is advertised without having a headphone jack and with a supplied Type-C to 3.5mm dongle, but you can't always carry the dongle around, can you? You'll miss the convenience of having one initially, but after a couple of weeks, you'll get used to it. If you get the OnePlus Type-C Bullets, you won't miss the 3.5mm jack in a very short time. The Type-C Bullets sound extremely good with the in-built DAC of the 6T.• BLURRY NIGHTSCAPE/NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: The Nightscape mode of the 6T could use some work. There are two modes of operation: 1) If the phone senses that it's being propped up by a stand or is stable, the camera takes longer to shoot low light pictures with a slow shutter, allowing more light to pass through. 2) If you're holding it in your hand, it takes approx 1~2s to shoot low light photos.The output is not always crisp. It's a bit blurry/smoothened out. As long as you don't zoom closely into the subject, it'll look good.• IN-BUILD SPEAKER & EARPIECE: The loudspeaker sounds slightly tinny with the highs overpowering the mids and the bass. You almost can't really hear the bass. The earpiece is kinda tiny and is placed on top of the frame of the device. It's almost invisible and sometimes (only sometimes) I have a hard time hearing the other person on the call. It's loud enough, just not clear enough.• EXTREMELY POOR HAPTIC VIBRATION: Trust me on this. The vibration motor on all OnePlus devices (Tested the OP X, 3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6 & 6T) are almost non-existent if you carry your phone in your jean pocket. You can only feel it if you're holding it in your hand. You'll NEVER feel it vibrating if you have it in your pocket.• BLURRY SELFIES: While the rear camera is top-notch, the front snapper is not so much. Agreed it gives out beautiful selfies, but that's only when it works properly. 2~3 photos out of 5 snapped using the front camera turn out blurred. You have to hold the phone REALLY steady if you want a good picture on the first attempt.Thumbs up if you found this helpful!\",\n",
       " 'Best phone of my life till now',\n",
       " \"I'll split the review into sections to make it easy to understand.Delivery 10/10: I placed the order on the 2nd since the 8/256 model was out of stock and I was supposed to receive the phone on the 4th however I was pleasantly surprised when the order shipped and was at my doorstep on the 2nd itself so kudos to the seller and Amazon for a great delivery experience.Now onto the phone...Build 8/10: The body of the phone is metal and the design is ergonomic. Not a huge change from the OP6 other than the lack of a fingerprint sensor. A lack of headphone jack is problematic.Screen 10/10: 6.44 inch 2560x1080 AMOLED display. A gorgeous display with vivid colors and true blacks, feels better than many 2K screens and the load on the battery is reduced massively as well. The notch is improved massively as well as it feels less intrusive and easier to adopt. With an 86% screen to body ratio, the experience is immersive.Internals and Software 10/10: 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage is future proof enough and can handle anything thrown at it. OxygenOS with Android Pie is greatly optimized with some useful features and the performance is fast, lag-free and snappy. SD845 is best in class and the GPU can handle heavy games with ease.Camera 9/10: While it sports the same lens as its predecessor, the software tweaks and optimization makes it feel like a massive upgrade with noticeably better photos than the OP6 as well as great improvement with the Night mode in taking photos in low light. You can shoot 720p video at 480fps as well as 4K 60fps (limited to 5 minutes at a stretch) and the inclusion of pro mode makes it easier to tweak the camera according to your needs. The front camera is crisp and an improvement over its predecessor. While it may not be as exceptional as the Pixel 3 or Note 9, it is still the best camera in its price range.Battery life ?/10: It's still too early to give an honest review about the battery life however the 3700mah capacity paired with the industry leading fast-charging technology makes it one of the best phone batteries. In my short use of the phone so far I've consistently got 4.5-5 hours SoT and the standby time is insane as well. This is one of the best phones battery management wise bar the Note 9.New features: While the fingerprint sensor is now embedded under the screen, it is more of a positive point for the screen to body ratio than the security aspect of the phone. While it definitely is not gimmicky, it is not completely useful as well. It's plenty fast despite being a first-generation in-screen reader however still slower than physical button readers as well as the native face unlock (which is really really good and insanely fast even in low light) If you're someone who disables face unlock and will only use your fingerprint then it is good enough for your daily needs.Sound 7/10: Due to the reduced notch, the earpiece is shifted into the top slit however it is still plenty audible and really clear. The speaker despite being a mono downward firing one is loud enough to play music and answer calls from far away. One issue I have with the bottom speaker is that despite being two grills, one on either side of the type C slot, there is only one speaker which is the left one which means if you cover it you will muffle 90% of the sound also by looking at the pictures you might assume it might be dual bottom firing speakers but it's only one (so it might seem like false advertising?) but still it doesn't affect the quality or the loudness of the sound one bit so I may be nitpicking here. A lack of headphone jack means you have to settle for bt audio or use the dongle provided by oneplus for free in the box. Since I am coming from an LG G6 which had a 32-bit Quad DAC it is a big letdown since USB-C audio is still garbage and wireless music still cannot compete in quality with wired.Conclusion:+Screen+Battery+Internals+Software+Camera+Phone comes with screen protector pre-applied and with a free transparent TPU case in the box so good on OP to think about the customer-no 3.5mm jack-no wireless charging (not important for me)BEST FLAGSHIP FOR UNDER 50K DESPITE LOSING THE HEADPHONE JACK, THE OTHER GOOD FEATURES MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. GO FOR IT!!!!\",\n",
       " \"Il try to give a detailed and honest (personal) review of the handset so that people looking to continue with the legacy of OP6T can make a choice. OP6T has not changed much in terms of RAM/ROM/SoC config, as it remains the same as OP6. My device config is 6GB/128GB with Snapdragon 835. The camera config also remains the same so you'd be getting the same pictures with OP6T as you were getting with OP6; apart from a minor s/w update which includes the Nightscape camera. Description as to what it does can be found online, but personally, I don't think it is making much improvement to the pictures that are captured in low light during the night. Another significant change is the display, as it contains the waterdrop notch instead of the boat-shaped notch, and also has a higher screen to body ratio as compared to the OP6. The result is a bigger screen and a viewing experience that is much better and less distracting than the OP6. The loss is that the company had to strip the LED notifications to make the notch smaller. I was not really that addicted to LED notifications, so it did not really make any difference to me. So if summed up, the display is something in which Id like to give the company some credit points for making a beautiful AMOLED display in 38K. Moving further, the major change which highlighted the device all during the launch - the inscreen fingerprint scanner. It is quite intuitive and an interesting concept, but I would say that it is still a territory for flagship manufacturers that need to be researched and improvised before it is made public. Again, as I said it is very intuitive and you'd be kind of amazed by the tech put behind it, but it kind of fails the fact that fingerprints are supposed to be an easy and fast way to unlock the device. Face ID is surely taking the smartphone industry by storm, but on any fine day, I'd use my fingerprint to unlock my device rather than the face. But OP6T has made me realize that Face ID is much easy to use and unlock the phone. And the reason is the slow fingerprint scanner. I could actually feel the time it takes to unlock the phone. And no, it doesn't take a second to unlock. On paper it is 0.34s, but I kind of felt the 0.34s being taken by my phone to unlock. It fails a little more than a couple of times a day when it doesn't recognize my finger/thumb, but Im guessing it might get fixed with some future software updates. Moreover, the Face ID comes to the rescue everytime the fingerprint scanner lets me down. The tech is new and interesting and still needs to be worked upon before it is launched in a flagship. The last major change is the loss of 3.5mm headphone jack. Now, this was something which OP could have dodged, but then how would have they given a better and bigger battery. The battery is 3700 mAh, which is bigger which means that even though you get more juice to run your phone, it takes probably longer for the dash charger to charge it. So coming back to the headphone jack, it is not there. Again, it does not really matter, as you get a single type C port, both for charging and plugging in a headset. You get a type C to USB adapter, and to be honest the 3.5mm jack would not create much stir as people are quickly moving towards wireless tech. Unless you have a high spec wired headset, then you may give it a thought.All in all, One Plus delivers with the new 6t. It has some highs and lows, but then its kind of giving you everything for 38K. Not many makers would offer you that. Its my first One Plus device, and I am pretty satisfied with it.\"]"
